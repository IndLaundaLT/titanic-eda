# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 🧠 Objective
To perform EDA on the Titanic dataset and uncover patterns and relationships affecting survival.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Key Steps
- Handled missing values
- Generated summary statistics
- Visualized age, fare, class, sex, and survival patterns
- Analyzed correlation and feature interactions

## 📌 Files Included
